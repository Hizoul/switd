\subsection{Basic Math behind ACO}

In ACO the most important move for us is in the Tower Defence Game is the \textit{State Transition Rule}. This is the formula that an Ant uses to decide where it goes to next as displayed here\cite{dorigo2006ant}:

\begin{equation}
p^k_{ij}=
\begin{cases}
\frac{\tau^\alpha_{ij}*n^\beta_{ij}}{\sum_{ciL\in N(s^P)}\tau^\alpha_{il}*n^\beta_{il}} \\
0 otherwise
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Looking at the formula in depth it is the probability that ant k, standing on node i will move to city j\cite{maniezzo2002ant}.
There are two factors that have an influence this probability.
First we have the pheromone level on the trail called $\tau^\alpha_{i\psi}$ which may optionally be weighted using $\alpha$.
Then there may also be an attractiveness parameter that uses a priori knowledge to influence the result called $n^\beta_{i\psi}$ which can optionally be weighted using $\beta$\cite{dorigo2006ant}.

Put into simple words this says the higher the pheromone level the higher the probability a path is chosen, but in the end it is still random which path is chosen, it is merely a weight for the choice itself.
The trail pheromone level $\tau^\alpha_{i\psi}$, will in our case be influenced based on the ants chosen behaviour explained in section \ref{sec:behaviour}. This chosen behaviour also influences the weights and may introduce slight alterations to the formula above.
