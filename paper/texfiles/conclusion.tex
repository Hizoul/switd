We have presented the basics of ant colony optimization and applied them to a tower defense game. With these basics we were able to show that the algorithms can be usefully applied to tower defense games.
For this tower defense implementation we have built a Web-UI that can be run in any browser. It enables the re-verification of our manual experiments (section \ref{sec:manualver}) as well as custom new experiments on the pre-made maps.
To better evaluate the different routing algorithms (section \ref{sec:behavior}), we run many experiments headlessly with many run-throughs for statistical relevance (section \ref{sec:autover}).

Concluding from both these experiments we can say that ACO can be useful for routing creeps in a tower defense game. Shortest Path with or without weight and on success only are viable options to route creeps even through a maze, but the weighted shortest path behavior will produce the least deaths. We also showed that we have found optimal parameters for the experiments by showing that different settings yield worse results (section \ref{sec:autover}).

There are still many more map constellations, creep behavior modifications, differing towers and more to try out as pointed out in the future work section \ref{sec:futurework}, but we successfully achieved a working ant colony optimization routing for creeps in tower defense games.
