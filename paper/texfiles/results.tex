This Section is divided into two subsections. First we present the results of manual experiments that we evaluate by hand via the UI that we implemented in Section \ref{sec:manualver}.
The second Section \ref{sec:autover} contains results we obtained and evaluated automatically by running the simulations headlessly.

\subsection{Manual Verifications}
\label{sec:manualver}
insert here text we wrote on google docs on meeting day


\subsection{Automatic Verifications}
\label{sec:autover}
For the automatic evaluation we did the following experiments across all maps. Because that produces a large amount of graphs to interpret we will here only display the ones we deem relevant.
