This Section is divided into two subsections. First we present the results of manual experiments that we evaluate by hand via the UI that we implemented in Section \ref{sec:manualver}.
The second Section \ref{sec:autover} contains results we obtained and evaluated automatically by running the simulations headlessly.

\subsection{Manual Verifications}

\subsection{Automatic Verifications}
\label{sec:autover}
For the automatic evaluation we tried varying settings and ran them across all maps. Because the amount of different parameters and the hence large amount of graphs to interpret we will here only mention and display the settings that we deemed relevant information. To be statistically relevant every experiment setting is run 50 times and we then take the mean value of that for the graph. We also always include Towers in the maps.

First of we will start out by excluding the Continous Vapor Behaviour in the next Figures because as Figure clearly shows, the runtime is
