We have presented the basics of a tower defense game and of ant colony optimization. With these basics we were able to show that the algorithms can be usefully applied to tower defense games.
For this tower defense implementation we have built a Web-UI that can be run in any browser. It enables the re-verification of our manual experiments (section \ref{sec:manualver}) as well as custom new experiments on the pre-made maps.
To better evaluate the different routing algorithms (section \ref{sec:behavior}), we run many experiments headlessly with many run-throughs for statistical relevance (section \ref{sec:autover}).

Concluding from both these experiments we can say that Ant Colony Optimization can produce useful results in a Tower Defense Game. Shortest Path with or without weight and on success only are viable options to route through a maze, but the weighted one will produce the least deaths. We also showed that we have found optimal parameters for the experiments by showing that different settings yield worse results (section \ref{sec:autover}).

There are still many more map constellations, ant behavior modifications, differing towers and more to try out as pointed out in the future work section \ref{sec:futurework}, but we successfully achieved a working ant colony optimization routing for tower defense games.
