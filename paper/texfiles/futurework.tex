Our experiments are far from exhaustive, but limited by time. Hence it is also important to point out what things still remain to be explored in future work.

The tower defense implementation described in section \ref{sec:implementationtech} is pretty basic and more a simulation than a real world one.
In a real tower defense game setting the towers will be built over time.  Furthermore the amount of towers that the player can build depends on the points that are gathered through killing creeps.
Usually one also distinguishes between different types of towers that deal different amounts of damage can use other target methods (area vs. single target damage)\cite[P. 57]{hernandez2015mathematics}.

Another important difference is that the spawend creeps in a regular tower defense game vary. This variation can encompass things like movement speed, health and even damage to towers\cite[P. 57]{hernandez2015mathematics}. Each of these is a potential parameter that could influence and be taken into account for the routing.

Another possible improvement would be to analyse even more maps than the one we described in section \ref{sec:testmaps}.
